For Portuguese, Sentiment Analysis research is still being established. In this context, this work proposes a method to estimate sentiment in social networks for the Portuguese language, focusing on Twitter. For such purpose, we used a Committee, which is implemented through a set of machine learning algorithms for classification. The evaluation of the proposed method was performed using statistical and performance tests. The results indicate that the Committee had better accuracy when compared to other machine learning algorithms for the performance tests. Nevertheless, there was no proven statistical difference between the Committee's algorithm and some of the algorithms, indicating that these methods could achieve equivalent accuracy to the Committee in some specific situations, such as a larger database.","tags":null,"title":"Análise de Sentimento em Redes Sociais para a Língua Portuguesa Utilizando Algoritmos de Classificação","type":"publication"}]
